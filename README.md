# Prework Study Guide Website

A study guide for pre-work

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

A beginner website from a student learning web development. I've been using tech for more than a decade, wanted to take my knowledge and experience with tech from intermediate to expert. For me that meant learning the knowledge necessary to build instead of just using. I had some surface level info about programming but not enough to create anything. This study guide helped me learn the process of taking text and turning it into a usable application. Learned the structure (HTML) for websites, how to style (CSS) the website to be more appealing to human users and how to add interactivity (JavaScript) to my website. Still learning, next steps for me are learning to make my websites more advanced, one step at a time.

Open Chrome DevTools with either, CTRL+SHIFT+I (for Windows) or COMMAND+OPTION+I (for MacOS), a console panel will open in the browser, click Console and you will see a list of topics I learned with a random suggestion on what to read first.
